# ReZapp
This repository is the landing page for ReZapp, which originally focuses on leveraging returned apparel from favourite consumer brands (Nike, Patagonia, Adiddas, etc.) for resale at a discounted price. I've later pivotted this project to [Daisy Goods] (https://github.com/AndyyZhu/Daisy-Goods).
